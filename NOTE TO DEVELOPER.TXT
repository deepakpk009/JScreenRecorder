Hi Developer,

this folder is a netbeans project folder, so if you are planning 
to edit the project just use netbeans IDE for editing.
open this folder from netbeans, it will auto detect the config.
Netbeans version 7.4 (updated developer version) was used to update the project.
the previous build will be in older versions of netbeans.

the fat jar (the single packed jar) is build using the script in the
build.xml. you can use it in other projects also.

hope this eases you development and one more thing,
please send feedback, bug reports or anything you may want to speak to
to deepakpk009@yahoo.in

Regards,
Deepak PK


*** HAPPY CODING ***
